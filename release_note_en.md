v1.8.0
======
Apr.24, 2024

* Update the read bytes of the status line 4 times per second.
* Reduced the number of times ERASELINE(ESC[K) is output for too slow terminal to improve the speed to update screen.

v1.7.1
======
Apr 16 2024

* Set cursor on or off when yes or no is asked.
* Fix the problem (since v.1.6.0) that the cursor position could become invalid after moving from a long line to a short line, causing a crash when editing.

v1.7.0
======
Apr 15 2024

* Added the `-auto` option to enable running automated tests even without Expect-Lua. Using this option, all test programs were rewritten in PowerShell. nkf32 is no longer required for testing.
* Added the `-16le` and `-16be` options to force interpretation as UTF-16 little-endian or big-endian encoding, respectively.
* `-semicolon`: Enabled using semicolons as field delimiters (for some European locales that use commas as decimal separators). Considered allowing arbitrary delimiter strings, but decided against it to avoid potential issues.
* `-nonutf8`: Added an option to handle cases where data is incorrectly interpreted as UTF-8 when it is not actually encoded that way.
* Added the `-help` option to display a list of available options.
* Increased the number of leading bytes checked to detect UTF-16 encoding from the previous value to 10 bytes.

- Rename from CSView to CSVI because not a few products that have the same name exist in the same category.

- Fix: `o` after `>`: the last line was joined with the previous line in the saved file.
- Prevent the displayed position from being incorrect even when it contains the character whose width is difficult to judge
- Fix: the problem abortion at starting on Windows 8.1
- Enable to build without `env GOEXPERIMENT=rangefunc`

v1.5.0
======
Mar 31 2024
