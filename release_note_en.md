* Removed measurement of display width for Unicode characters of ambiguous width
  * Removed the `-aw`, `-an`, and `-debug-bell` options
  * To treat ambiguous-width characters as double-width, set the environment variable `RUNEWIDTH_EASTASIAN=1`; to treat them as single-width, unset or remove the `RUNEWIDTH_EASTASIAN` variable
* When the environment variable `COLORFGBG` is defined in the form `(FG);(BG)` and `(FG)` is less than `(BG)`, the program now uses color settings designed for light backgrounds (equivalent to `-rv`).
* Moved the code for parsing the command line options from the main package at `cmd/csvi` to the subpackage `startup`
* Fixed an issue where executing `echo "ihihi" | csvi -auto "w|-|q|y" > file` resulted in the contents of `file` being `\r   Calibrating terminal... (press any key to skip)\r"ihihi"` instead of just `"ihihi"`.
* Removed the deprecated function `(Config) Main`

v1.15.0
=======
Oct 10, 2025

* Added key bindings `]` and `[` to adjust the width of the current column (widen and narrow, respectively).
* Added `-rv` option to prevent unnatural colors on terminals with a white background
* At startup, the width of ambiguous-width Unicode characters was being measured, but on terminals that do not support the cursor position query sequence `ESC[6n`, this could cause a hang followed by an error. To address this:
    * `-aw` (treat ambiguous-width characters as 2 cells) and `-an` (treat ambiguous-width characters as 1 cell) options were added to skip the measurement and explicitly specify the character width.
    * If `ESC[6n` is not supported, the program now continues without aborting.
* Suppress color output if the `NO_COLOR` environment variable is set (following https://no-color.org/ )
* Added support for FreeBSD/amd64
* Added API functions `(Config) EditFromStringSlice`, `uncsv.NewRowFromStringSlice` and and `(*_Application) MessageAndGetKey`.
* Split the `"csvi"` package into subpackages such as `"internal/ansi"`, `"internal/manualctl"`, `"legacy"`, and `"candidate"`.

v1.14.0
=======
Jun 2, 2025

* Added `L` (Shift-L) command to reload the file using a specified encoding to correct detection errors
   - Encoding name completion is supported.
   - UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE are not supported yet.
* Added search command (`*` and `#`) to find the next occurrence of the current cell's content

v1.13.1
=======
Jun 25, 2025

* Made it possible to build with Go 1.20.14 to support Windows 7, 8, and Server 2008 or later.

v1.13.0
=======
May 14, 2025

## ðŸš€ Experimental Release for macOS Users

This release includes a **macOS build for the first time**!

We don't have access to a macOS environment, so we can't test it ourselves.
If you're a macOS user and willing to help, **please try it and report back** through GitHub Issues or Discussions.

Thank you for your support!

## Other changes

- Added `-title` option to display a title row above the header row.

v1.12.0
=======
Oct 8, 2024

* Fix: panic when 0 bytes files (`nul` or `/dev/null`) were given

* `-semicolon`: Enabled using semicolons as field delimiters (for some European locales that use commas as decimal separators). Considered allowing arbitrary delimiter strings, but decided against it to avoid potential issues.
* `-nonutf8`: Added an option to handle cases where data is incorrectly interpreted as UTF-8 when it is not actually encoded that way.
* Added the `-help` option to display a list of available options.
* Increased the number of leading bytes checked to detect UTF-16 encoding from the previous value to 10 bytes.
